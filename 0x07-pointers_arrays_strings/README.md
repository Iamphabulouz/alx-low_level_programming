In computer programming, a 2D array is a data structure that represents a matrix-like structure with rows and columns. It is also known as a two-dimensional array or matrix.

A 2D array can be defined as an array of arrays, where each element of the outer array holds an inner array of the same length. Each element in the inner array represents a single value in the 2D array, which can be accessed using two indices, one for the row and one for the column.

2D arrays are useful for representing grids, tables, and other data structures that have a two-dimensional layout. They are commonly used in graphics, image processing, and scientific simulations, among other applications.
