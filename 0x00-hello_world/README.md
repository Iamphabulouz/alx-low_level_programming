C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is a high-level programming language that is often used for system programming, embedded systems, and applications that require high performance and low-level access to computer hardware.

C is a compiled language, which means that the code is compiled into machine language that can be executed by the computer's processor. The language has a relatively small set of keywords and constructs, which makes it a relatively simple language to learn and use.

C is widely used for developing operating systems, device drivers, embedded systems, and other software that requires direct access to hardware. It is also used in applications that require high performance and efficient memory usage, such as scientific computing, image processing, and game development.

C has had a significant impact on the development of computer programming, and many other programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Python, have been influenced by C. It is still widely used today, despite being over 40 years old, and remains an important language for many software developers.
