In C, a function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can be used to break up a large program into smaller, more manageable pieces, and can be reused in different parts of a program. C provides a number of built-in functions, such as printf() and scanf(), but programmers can also create their own functions to perform specific tasks.

A C function consists of a function header and a function body. The function header specifies the name of the function, the data type of the value it returns (if any), and the parameters that the function accepts (if any). The function body contains the actual code that performs the task of the function.

Here is an example of a simple C function:

int add(int a, int b) {
    int sum = a + b;
    return sum;
}
In this example, the function is named add, and it takes two integer parameters, a and b. The function adds these two parameters together and stores the result in a variable called sum. Finally, the function returns the value of sum using the return keyword.

Functions can be called from other parts of a program, such as other functions or the main program. To call a function, you simply use the name of the function and pass in any required parameters. For example, to call the add function from the previous example, you could use the following code:

int result = add(5, 7);
This code would call the add function with the parameters 5 and 7, and would store the result of the function in a variable called result.

Overall, functions are an important part of the C programming language, as they allow programmers to create reusable code that can be used in different parts of a program.
