Functions:
A function is like a mini-program within a larger program that performs a specific task. Functions can be thought of as reusable blocks of code that take input, perform a computation, and return output. In programming, functions are used to organize code into smaller, more manageable parts that can be tested and debugged independently of the rest of the program. Functions can also be used to avoid repetition of code and improve code readability.

For example, let's say you have a program that needs to perform a complex calculation multiple times. Rather than repeating the same code in several places throughout the program, you can create a function that performs the calculation and call that function whenever you need to perform the calculation. This makes the program more modular and easier to maintain.

Nested Loops:
A loop is a programming construct that allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times. Nested loops are loops that are placed inside other loops. Nested loops are used when you need to perform a task multiple times, but each repetition of the task requires another repetition of a smaller task. For example, let's say you have a program that needs to print a square pattern of asterisks. You can achieve this by using a nested loop - an outer loop that controls the rows and an inner loop that controls the columns.

Here's an example of nested loops in action:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {     // Outer loop for rows
  for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {   // Inner loop for columns
    printf("* ");
  }
  printf("\n");                   // Print a new line after each row
}
This code will print a square pattern of asterisks with 5 rows and 5 columns. The outer loop controls the rows, and the inner loop controls the columns. The inner loop prints an asterisk for each column, and the outer loop repeats this for each row.
