In C, a variable is a named location in memory that is used to store a value. Variables allow programmers to store and manipulate data in their programs. Before a variable can be used in a program, it must be declared with a specific data type, such as int (for integers), float (for floating-point numbers), or char (for characters).

In C, variables are declared using the following syntax:

<type> <name>;
For example, to declare an integer variable called x, you would use the following code:

int x;
After a variable is declared, it can be assigned a value using the assignment operator (=). For example, to assign the value 5 to the variable x, you would use the following code:

x = 5;
You can also declare and initialize a variable in a single statement. For example, the following code declares and initializes an integer variable called y with the value 10:

int y = 10;
C variables can be used in arithmetic expressions and can be passed as arguments to functions. The scope of a variable refers to the region of the program in which the variable is visible and can be accessed. C allows variables to have either global or local scope, depending on where they are declared.

Overall, variables are an essential part of the C programming language and allow programmers to store and manipulate data in their programs.
